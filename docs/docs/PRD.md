# ðŸŽµ SpotiAI â€“ Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## 1. Problem Statement
Today, Spotify users can view Wrapped once a year to reflect on their listening history.  
However, users **cannot interact dynamically** with their music and podcast data,  
nor can they extract **personalized, bite-sized learning** from podcast episodes theyâ€™ve listened to.

There is a growing demand for **personal, conversational experiences** tied to content consumption â€”  
**SpotiAI** fills this gap by enabling users to **chat** with their listening history and get **micro-summaries** from podcasts they engage with.

| Social Sharer | Enjoys sharing Spotify insights and moments on social media. |

## 3. Goals and Objectives
